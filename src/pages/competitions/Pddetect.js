            The objective of the project was to use machine learning to detect Parkinson's Disease (PD) at an earlier stage. Since PD affects muscle rigidity
            and speech, datasets with analyzed voice recordings and drawings of spirals and waves, respectively, were retrieved. Separate tests were performed on each
            dataset with the random forest classifier. In a realistic situation, a weighted average with the weights being the accuracies of the models would be used to combine the predictions
            based on speech and the drawings.
